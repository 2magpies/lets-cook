**Let's Cook!**

_Letâ€™s Cook!_ is for people that love to cook. The application updates daily with a random recipe. The recipes are crowd-sourced and come from all over the world via TheMealDB. Additionally, users have the option to request the app to suggest a different recipe.

**Coding**
I decided to start with components I was confident I knew how to code. The _Site Info_ consists of hard-coded content presented in a sidebar.

Next, I added a search feature. User-defined searches are not a feature I included in the initial design, but the api supports search, and as I recently participated in a lab ("Giphy-Searcher") provided by Jennifer Meade where I learned to implement search using an api, I decided it would be wise to start with functionality with which I am familiar. Following the lab approach to start with hard-coded code, I added a variable using two images from the vendor site. 

The Giphy-Searcher lab also provided CSS formatting for the search form and results that I decided to use temporarily. This approach helped me get my site with limited features up and running (and attractive!) very quickly. Early success is encouraging. This approach also puts me in "editing mode" which is less daunting than "white board mode."
